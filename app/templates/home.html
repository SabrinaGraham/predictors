          <p  class="lead">“If you want a peaceful Jamaica, you have to play a part. We need to expose the wrongdoings of all kinds, and the ‘informer’ is a hero. I am not asking you to come forward and tell the gangster ‘mi tell the police you have a gun’. That would be stupid, and you must use your intelligence. Bravery does not mean you expose yourself, but it means you have the audacity to call Crime Stop or go to a justice of the peace” - JUSTICE MINISTER DelroyChuck </p>

          <p class="lead">The user's safety is of utmost importance and as such is our first priority in the implementation of this application. 
            We encourage all our users and stakeholders to utilize the data and resources presented here for their safety and consideration. The app provides

          <h4>Other Tips: </h4>
          <ol>
            <li class="lead">Don’t Travel Far After Dark - If you are staying in a hotel, it is best for you to be back by nightfall. Whether you are traveling by foot or car, it isn’t advised to be out on the street at night.</li><br>  
            <li class="lead">Travel in Numbers - Even if you are in the safest place to live in Jamaica, walking around freely isn't a great idea. While traveling alone during the day isn’t particularly unsafe, it is definitely advised against at night. It is best for tourists to always travel in numbers at all times. Traveling as part of a pack will make you less of a target and will help you to become more aware of your surroundings. </li><br> 
            <li class="lead">Carry Cash, but Just Enough - To avoid having to use ATM’s and credit cards, it is best to carry cash. However, you don’t need to take all of your spending money with you everywhere you go.</li><br> 
            <li class="lead">Don’t Seek Out Criminal Activity - f you go looking for criminal activity, you easily make yourself a victim of a more violent crime that you essentially can’t report because of your actions. Avoid this situation altogether by sticking to strictly legal behavior.</li><br> 
            <li class="lead">Do not flash expensive bling - Eyes are everywhere and it could make you a mark as someone "rich".</li><br>

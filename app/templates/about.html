<h1>About</h1>
<p>Jamaica is a small island located in the Caribbean. It has an area of 10,992  and a population of approximately 2.984 million people, as of 2022. It is the 165th largest country by area in the world and the 138th largest by population. Despite its small size, the country flaunts a surprisingly high crime rate. According to the World Population Review, Jamaica ranks 10th in the countries with the highest crime rate in the world. The type of crimes committed varies, including but limited to homicides, theft, and sexual assault. These crimes happen at all times of the day, throughout the country. The frequency of crime in the country is coupled with another issue; citizens are apprehensive in reporting criminal activities because this possibly poses a great risk to their lives. With a situation as dire as crime, an approach that is proactive, rather than reactive is preferred as it can be the difference between life and death or some other life changing outcome. While the citizen has a general idea of crime-plagued areas and types of crimes committed, they are not privy to all crimes committed, the location of the crimes, and when they were committed. This prevents them from being undeniably sure of the likelihood of any type of crime in a specific area. The security forces also lack a method that puts them a step ahead by predicting the likelihood of some crime. As such, the solution of crime forecasting, or prediction is presented.
    The idea behind the crime predictor is that it will serve as a valuable tool that provides assistance in the fight against crime in the country. In an effort to increase the proactivity of Jamaican citizens, the tool will equip them with more accurate information on the types of crime that are likely to take place in a specific area, at a specific time of the day. With this information citizens would be more alert and have a better idea of what to expect. With the anonymity provided by the crime prediction application, it is also expected that citizens would be inclined to make more reports, thus contributing up-to-date, real-time information to the crime statistics of the country. The application also removes the hassle of going to the police station to make a report. The ease of process is also expected to increase the likelihood of crime being reported by individuals, further contributing to the accuracy of the crime prediction as more data from the reports are fed into the AI model. Security personnel would also be equipped with information that would help tackle crime. Thus, helping to prevent more crimes. This is accomplished by providing an accurate outlook of the likelihood of different types of criminal activities in any area at any given time. This aids in planning and prevention of crime. Citizens would be better able to be proactive, security personnel would have better information to make more informed decisions on the step forward to tackling crime, and a general idea of what crime would be like in a few years or months would also be provided. The main goal of this tool is to provide an avenue for planning and prevention, consequently increasing the safety of Jamaican citizens.
